I wanted to work in tech before I even knew what kind of positions existed. From a young age I was interested in logical things. These interests developed skills that I think fit well with the tech industry. I fell in love with chess by six, strategy video games by eleven, and web animation by thirteen. When I was in middle school, I was absorbed with choreographed action scenes from popular animated series such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_Xiao" target="_blank">Xiao Xiao</a>, <a href="http://deletionquality.net/animation/view/oscar/castle-ii" target="_blank">Castle</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9F7FKcz80k" target="_blank">Madness Combat</a> (NSFW), and <a href="https://youtu.be/VufDd-QL1c0" target="_blank">Animator vs Animation</a>.
<br /><br />
I quickly got my hands on a copy of Macromedia Flash Player 8 and dove straight into making short clips. The default FPS was 12. My animations looked choppy no matter how carefully I drew them. I realized there is a skill to making a smooth animation in the lowest FPS possible. Drawing 12 frames takes roughly half the time of drawing 24, and a quarter of 48, makes sense. So I learned tweens and pans next which allow you to draw only 2 frames and automagically animate any number of frames in between. Despite my best efforts, I felt overshadowed by a friend of mine who was constantly creating animations twice as good in half the time. I lost my inspiration for animation not long after it began but continued to watch and appreciate the creations of others.

At thirteen I was a volunteer moderator for gamereplays.org (think reddit for strategy video games). I stumbled across technical web discussions amongst the administrators of the website which lead me to try my hands at building a website of my own. I built it, but never ended up showing it to anyone due to fear of criticism.
<br /><br />
Programming appealed to the logical part of my brain unlike any other subject. The part that constantly craved bigger and harder challenges. Everything had a reason, nothing was random, even if I didn’t know the reason at the time. In highschool my friends and I would stay up through the night doing online puzzles such as <a href="http://notpron.org/notpron/notpron.htm" target="_blank">NotPron</a>, <a href="http://www.ouverture-facile.com/start/rules.html" target="_blank">Ouverture facile</a>, and the <a href="http://www.timtang.com/ttt/" target="_blank">Tim Tang Test</a>. They are arbitrary real world puzzles that increase in difficulty as you progress. If you haven’t heard of them, they are awesome, you should try them.

I recall one problem where we discovered the longitude and latitude of a art museum in China via the source code. We then had to use a combination of ASCII, Morse, and binary to decipher a list of encrypted directions which we then used to traverse the museum via an online portal. The solution was the painter’s name that created the art piece we were looking at. It was exhilarating for us to pool our knowledge together and successfully tackle these difficult challenges.
<br /><br />
Correctly solving a puzzle was intrinsically rewarding unlike anything else in my life. However after some time solving puzzles in isolation began to lose its appeal. Outwitting an opponent in a one on one duel was new and sexy. I began to play StarCraft II seriously. At school I talked about StarCraft, at home I read about StarCraft, on weekends I would watch or attend StarCraft tournaments, at night I would dream about StarCraft. I became <i>that StarCraft guy</i>. I memorized every strategy, I practiced each opening, and I understood how the first 5 minutes of almost any game could play out. I analysed every single match I played, sometimes multiple times, from many perspectives, at various speeds. I developed my own signature playstyle, I knew every strategy, and it felt good to have strong domain knowledge that I could execute on demand. Suffice to say I became very good at the game.

<br /><br />
This was really my first true passion. Something I prioritized and valued enough to dedicate thousands of hours to improve through trial-and-error, reflection, communication, and research. From this experience I learned that what you put in is what you get. I also realized people often fail to recognize this simple fact. When I started I was horrible, like everyone else I was clueless. But after two to three years and thousands of games I got alright and people would say I was 'gifted' or 'talented', neither of which I take as a compliment.
<br /><br />
I’m not sure where else to focus my attention. I took plenty of coding courses (some in french because <i>reasons</i>). I played Magic The Gathering, I did rubik's cubes, and I did coding contests for fun. I was lucky the school I went to didn’t stigmatise these things too much.
<br /><br />
I’m still not sure where exactly I’m going to land in technology, I suspect it’ll be some architectural big picture-esque role since that’s where I’ve been happiest. I’ve just graduated university. Being a software developer is fun, building web apps is fun, being a tech lead is interesting, starting a company is interesting. I’m curious what the second chapter of my story will look like a few years from now.
